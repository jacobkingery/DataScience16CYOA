In our exploration phase, these relationships were also evident. What we're seeing, at a high level, is that crime reporting or crime report filing over the past 10+ years in San Francisco has followed a similar pattern - the same types of crime are being committed with relatively similar frequency, in the same general locations, and are being reported by the expected reporting entity. \n",
